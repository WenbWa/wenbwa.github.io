abstract: The study of human clothing dynamics has predominantly relied on synthetic datasets. While providing ease of ground-truth data acquisition, they often fall short in realism and fail to capture authentic clothing dynamics. Addressing this gap, we introduce 4DCHASE, the first real-world 4D dataset, advancing human clothing research with its detailed 4D textured scans and garment meshes. 4DCHASE captures 60 outfits in 480 human motion sequences and sums up to a total of 72k textured scans. The creation of a real-world clothing dataset is challenging, particularly in annotating and segmenting the extensive and complex 4D human scans. To address this, we developed a semi-automatic 4D human parsing pipeline, efficiently combining human expertise with automation to accurately label diverse garments and body movements. Leveraging precise annotations and high-quality garment meshes, we establish multiple benchmarks for clothing simulation, reconstruction, and parsing. We show that 4DCHASE offers realistic and challenging data, surpassing what is achievable with synthetic sources, thus paving the way for advancements in lifelike human clothing research.
