I'm a master's student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) majoring in [Robotics, Systems and Control](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html). Before that, I spent one year at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) as an exchange student and received my bachelor’s degree in Automation from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).

During my master's study, I delivered my thesis paper in the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html). After this, I took one research internship at the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS)](https://is.mpg.de/), Tübingen, Germany. 

Currently, I'm a research assistant at the [Advanced Interactive Technologies Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, working with [Dr. Jie Song](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/song) and [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges).

My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I delivered several projects on perceiving, reconstructing, and simulating daily objects and humans.
