## About Me

I'm currently a PhD student at [The University of Sydney, Australia](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-computer-science.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Chang Xu](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/c-xu.html). 

Previously, I completed my master’s degree at [ETH Zurich, Switzerland](https://ethz.ch/en.html), specializing in [Robotics, Systems and Control](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html). Before that, I spent one year as an exchange student at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) and earned my bachelor’s degree in Science of Automation from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).

During my master's study at ETH Zurich, I conducted my thesis at the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html), and worked as a research assistant at the [Advanced Interactive Technologies Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/) with [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges).

Before starting my PhD, I also completed an internship at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/?msockid=17a598ce889469f02b858d8889fa684e), where I researched the integration of large models with robotics. Broadly, my research interests span robotics, computer vision and machine learning.
