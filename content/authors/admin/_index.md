I'm currently a master student at ETH Zurich in the major of Robotics, Systems and Control. Before that, I spent one year at UC Berkeley as one exchange student and  received my bachelor’s degree in Automation from Beijing Institute of Technology.

During my master studies, I delivered my thesis in the Computational Robotics Lab at ETH Zurich under the supervision of Prof. Stelian Coros. After this, I took one research internship at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (MPI-IS), Tübingen, Germany. Currently, I'm a research assistent at the Advanced Interactive Technologies Lab at ETH Zurich, working with Dr. Jie Song and Prof. Otmar Hilliges.

My research interests include computer vision, machine learning, and robotics. I delivered several projects on perceiving, reconstructing, and simulating daily objects and humans.
