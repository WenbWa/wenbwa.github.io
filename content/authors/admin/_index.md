I'm currently a PhD student at [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-computer-science.html), under the supervision of [Prof. Chang Xu](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/about/our-people/academic-staff/c-xu.html). 

Previously, I completed my master‚Äôs degree at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), specializing in [Robotics, Systems and Control](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/robotics-systems-and-control.html). Before that, I spent one year at [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) as an exchange student and earned my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Science of Automation from [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/).

During my master's study, I conducted my thesis at the [Computational Robotics Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich under the supervision of [Prof. Stelian Coros](https://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html), and worked as a research assistant at the [Advanced Interactive Technologies Lab](https://ait.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich, with [Dr. Jie Song](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/song) and [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges).

Before starting my PhD, I also completed a research-based internship at [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-asia/?msockid=17a598ce889469f02b858d8889fa684e), where I explored the integration of large models with robotics. Broadly, my research interests span robotics, computer vision and machine learning.

Personally, I play tennis üéæ during the summer and go skiing ‚õ∑Ô∏è when the snow falls.
