Our dataset contains 4D textured and semantic scans of 60 real-world human outfits in tight and loose garments, with more than 480 motion sequences and 72K scan frames in total. Together with the registered SMPL(-X) body models and captured multi-view images with pixel-wise annotations, our dataset builds the foundation for future works in human parsing and reconstruction, semantic human avatar learning, realistic cloth reconstruction and simulation.
